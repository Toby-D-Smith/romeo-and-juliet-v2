ROMEO: Juligit, Oh Juligit, Where are you, I have a git to commit!

JULLIET: Sir Romeo, bid me forewell as I am sick!

ROMEO: You are sick! This is frightful news, tell me, can I write a code to make you better?

JULLIET: Yes, good sir. 

ROMEO: Excelent! Unfortunately this is only my first day at the school of code bootcamp, you might have to wait a little while until I produce anything that cures sickness!

False promises are not good for the soul, I accept the treachery that has befallen me :(
